**Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Overview**

(1) Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data, improve their performance, and adapt to new situations without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. This approach allows ML models to identify patterns and relationships within data to make predictions or decisions, rather than following fixed rules.
